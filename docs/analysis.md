# Analysis

## Wireframes and Prototypes

During the analysis phase, we created wireframes to visualize the key user interactions and design flows of the application. These wireframes were essential for gathering feedback from the client and adjusting the design based on their requirements.

### Key Features Identified

Based on discussions with the client, we identified the following core features for the project:

1. - **Gamification Layer for Sports Lessons**:
     
     - A dynamic system that overlays a gamification layer on top of traditional sports exercises, enhancing engagement for children and young adults. This system allows for themes like Brawl Stars, Fortnite, or any other trending games to be applied to sports lessons.
   
   - **Automated Theme Application**:
     
     - The tool automatically suggests and applies creative layers (e.g., Brawl Stars or The Masked Singer) based on predefined lesson plans, reducing the manual input needed for less creative instructors and encouraging more interactive and playful learning experiences.
   
   - **User-friendly Lesson Customization**:
     
     - Teachers can easily upload their existing sports lessons or PDFs and choose from a selection of themes. The system will then automatically generate exercises and activities in line with the chosen theme, providing flexibility and simplicity.
   
   - **Collaboration and Feedback Integration**:
     
     - Instructors can collaborate with other educators and easily share or adapt gamified lesson plans. A built-in feedback system allows instructors to refine and adjust exercises based on real-time student engagement.
   
   - **Cross-Discipline Usability**:
     
     - Although initially designed for sports lessons, the system can also be adapted for other activities such as scouting, team-building exercises, or general physical education. The flexibility ensures that different domains can benefit from the gamification tool.

## Analysis Methodologies

We employed various analysis methodologies to ensure a robust understanding of the project requirements, including:

- **Use Cases**: These documented the interactions between users and the system, identifying different scenarios the software must support.

- **BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation)**: For visualizing the workflows involved in the project.

- **Informational Modeling**: Mapping out the relationships between data objects used within the application.
  
  *These will be added in the future*

## Feature Prioritization

To ensure a structured approach to development, we used a MoSCoW prioritization method, which helped us categorize features into:

- **Must-Haves**: Core features without which the project cannot succeed.
- **Should-Haves**: Important but not essential features.
- **Could-Haves**: Optional features that add value but can be deferred if necessary.
- **Won't-Haves**: Features that were out of scope for this project.
