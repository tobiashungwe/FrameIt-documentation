# Handover and Documentation (Future Plan)

## Planned Handover Process

Upon completion of the project, we aim to implement a structured handover process to ensure that the client can independently manage, maintain, and extend the system. The future handover process will include:

### 1. **Final Product Demonstration**

- We plan to conduct a live demonstration with the client, showcasing all features and how they work, with a recorded session for future reference.

### 2. **User Documentation**

- A comprehensive user manual will be developed, which will include:
  - Detailed instructions on how to use the system’s features such as account management, lesson customization, and feedback access.
  - Easy-to-follow steps for navigating the platform.

### 3. **Technical Documentation**

- We will provide a technical guide for developers, covering:
  - The system architecture, explaining each component.
  - A breakdown of the codebase, key modules, and classes.
  - Instructions for setting up the development environment and extending the system.

### 4. **Code Maintenance Guide**

- A guide for maintaining and updating the codebase will be created, focusing on:
  - Best practices for adding new themes and features.
  - Guidelines for troubleshooting and handling common issues.
  - Proper use of GitLab for managing the project’s version control.

### 5. **Future Support**

- Although not part of the core deliverables, we plan to offer a limited period of post-project support to help the client transition smoothly and ensure they are comfortable with managing the system.
