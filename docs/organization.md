# Organization

## Daily Stand-Up

Our daily stand-up meetings followed the standard agile methodology. We would meet at the start of each day to discuss:

1. What we worked on yesterday.
2. What we plan to work on today.
3. Any blockers or issues we're currently facing.

Each team member had a chance to share their progress, and any roadblocks were discussed collectively to find a solution.

## Whiteboard Sessions

To foster collaboration and brainstorming, we used both physical and digital whiteboards (e.g., Miro). These sessions helped us:

- Visualize project flows.
- Break down complex tasks.
- Discuss different solutions for problems encountered during development.

### Tools:

- [Mirosoft whiteboard ]([Microsoft Whiteboard](https://whiteboard.office.com/me/whiteboards/p/c3BvOmh0dHBzOi8vc3R1ZGVudGhvd2VzdC1teS5zaGFyZXBvaW50LmNvbS9wZXJzb25hbC93YXJkX2dvdmFlcnQyX3N0dWRlbnRfaG93ZXN0X2Jl/b!T8mxkJCeBkit1cZMYf7Mi5FrKRUBoX9PnBAOGRCuqQxrQiDmXPP-Ta1Ok-fzAH3T/015ZVSWSZZPNPZNDLFLVHKBAUOILS6NHGV)) (For digital whiteboarding)

## Internal Communication

For internal team communication, we used the following tools:

- **Slack**: For day-to-day communication.
- **GitLab Issues**: To track tasks and their progress.
- **Google Meet**: For remote meetings when not on campus or at the client’s office.

Weekly updates were also sent via email to ensure that both the client and our coaches were well-informed of the project’s progress.

### Meetings with the Client

We held weekly check-ins with the client, either in person or via Google Meet, to present progress and gather feedback. This helped us stay aligned with the client’s expectations and incorporate feedback into our sprints.
