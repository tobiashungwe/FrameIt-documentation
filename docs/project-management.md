# Project Management

## Tools and Methodologies

To manage the project effectively, we adopted agile methodologies, allowing us to iterate quickly and respond to changes as they arose. The following tools and processes were used throughout the project:

### 1. **Version Control: GitLab**

- We used GitLab for version control to track code changes and collaborate efficiently across the team. Each feature or bug fix was developed in separate branches and reviewed through merge requests before being integrated into the main branch.
- GitLab Issues were used to manage our tasks and backlog, ensuring that everything was clearly assigned and tracked.

### 2. **Task Management: Gitlab**

- Gitlab was used for task management. We created boards to manage the sprint tasks, and each task moved through different stages (To Do, In Progress, and Done). This provided a clear overview of the project's status at any given time.

### 3. **Agile Sprints and Stand-Ups**

- We broke down the development work into sprints of two weeks. At the start of each sprint, we had a planning meeting where we assigned tasks based on the project's priorities.
- Daily stand-up meetings were held to discuss progress, blockers, and next steps. This ensured smooth communication and alignment between all team members.

### 4. **Weekly Client Meetings**

- Weekly meetings with the client were scheduled to provide updates on progress, gather feedback, and adjust the project scope as necessary. These meetings were critical for staying aligned with the client’s needs and ensuring that the project was on track.

### 5. **Documentation and Progress Tracking**

- We kept detailed documentation of our progress using GitLab’s wiki and regularly updated the project documentation as tasks were completed or requirements changed. This helped maintain clarity and ensured that any new team members could quickly get up to speed.

### 6. **Feedback and Retrospectives**

- At the end of each sprint, we held a retrospective to reflect on what went well and what could be improved. This feedback was invaluable in adjusting our workflow and ensuring continuous improvement throughout the project.

## Risk Management

Several risks were identified early in the project, and contingency plans were put in place. Some of the key risks included:

- **Scope Creep**: We managed this risk by clearly defining project requirements with the client and regularly reviewing them during client meetings.
- **Technical Challenges**: Given the complexity of the gamification features, we dedicated extra time for research and prototyping early in the project to mitigate technical risks.
- **Time Management**: Sprints were carefully planned to ensure that we met deadlines, and buffer time was included in case of unforeseen challenges.
